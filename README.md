### Here i'm stashing some things that may come to handy sometimes.
### If you came here somehow, well, use that if you want.


For now this repository contains theese things:


   -c2dd (Stands for "console 2d drawing". Simple, unoptimized, buggy and mostly untested library that I commonly use for pseudographical stuff and even though absolutely do not recommend using for anything).
